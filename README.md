HW4B 

Requirements:

For this assignment, you need to turn in:
-	You may work in teams of two persons.
-	All code which you submit must be your own.
-	Please turn in, a printed listing of your code and test cases showing 
        tree insertions and deletions as an electronic, zipped EMAIL to your 
        instructor.


Binary Search Trees

1.	[16 pts] Implement a BST based on our text’s algorithms for MINIMUN, 
        MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, PREDECESSOR, INSERT, DELETE, and PRINT.

NOTES:
•	You do NOT need to implement SEARCH

•	Your BST implementation should support an arbitrary object as its key 
        (i.e., not just an integer), so that it will be able to support the 
        RB-Tree implementation below.

•	Your BST implementation should use the T.Nil-style nil nodes as 
        described in the RB-Tree chapter, so nil nodes can support the parent, 
        child, and color attributes that an RB-Tree needs.


AND 
Red-Black Trees

2.	[24 pts] Implement RB-INSERT and RB-DELETE.
